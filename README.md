## Robust encoding of sub-sniff temporal information in the mouse olfactory bulb

Code to create all figures used in "Robust encoding of sub-sniff temporal information in the mouse olfactory bulb" available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.26.586830v1

This code requires two additional repositories for helper functions: warnerwarner/neurolytics and warnerwarner/binary_pulses

Download the three repositories and add the the two other repositories to your Python Path. Each figure is constructed using a single Jupyter notebook. There will be additional cells included which are not used in the final figure however, running all will generate the final figure


### Intall time
Install time should be almost instaneous - it'll take time to set up the python environment - but that is outside the scope of this repository. None of the notebooks are particularly heavy so all should be runnable on a standard laptop in a few minutes

Any problems - contact through the github issue page
